      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>My name is <strong>Jeff Ford</strong> and I was born on April 12th of 1980, in Aberdeen, Washington. The youngest child in my family, I grew up in Aberdeen and attended the <a href="http://www.asd5.org/highschool">local public high school</a>, where I was a left-handed pitcher on the baseball team.</p>

      <p>After high school, I moved to Seattle to attend the University of Washington.  I eventually graduated from UW with a Bachelor's degree in political science.</p>

      <p>I began working in the state legislature after college, and soon joined the Army Reserves. The decision to join the Army Reserves was a big one, and it had a more significant impact on my life than I expected.  In my thirteen years of service, I was on active-duty for five of them.</p>

      <p>One benefit of the military was that I had the opportunity to see new places.  Places that I have lived because of the military include:
        <ul class="places"><em>
          <li>Texas</li>
          <li>South Carolina</li>
          <li>Virginia</li></em>
        </ul>
      I also lived in Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia">DC</abbr> (unrelated to the military), and did three overseas deployments.
      </p>

      <p>I enjoy watching movies.  Here is a list of my favorites:
        <ol>
          <li>Kong: Skull Island</li>
          <li>Logan</li>
          <li>Get Out</li>
          <li>The Shack</li>
          <li>Beauty and the Beast</li>
          <li>Ghost in the Shell</li>
          <li>The Lego Batman Movie</li>
          <li>Moonlight</li>
          <li>Hidden Figures</li>
          <li>La La Land</li>
        </ol>


      <p class="closing">I hope to graduate from Code Fellows and get a job as a software developer.</p>
