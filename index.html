      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>My name is <strong>Jeff Ford</strong> and I was born on April 12th of 1980, in Aberdeen, Washington. The youngest child in my family, I grew up in Aberdeen and attended the <a href="http://www.asd5.org/highschool">local public high school</a>, where I was a left-handed pitcher on the baseball team.</p>

      <p>After high school, I moved to Seattle to attend the University of Washington.  I eventually graduated from UW with a Bachelor's degree in political science.</p>

      <p>I began working in the state legislature after college, and soon joined the Army Reserves. The decision to join the Army Reserves was a big one, and it had a more significant impact on my life than I expected.  In my thirteen years of service, I was on active-duty for five of them.</p>

      <p>One benefit of the military was that I had the opportunity to see new places.  Places that I have lived because of the military include:
          <ul class="places"><em>
              <li>Texas</li>
              <li>South Carolina</li>
              <li>Virginia</li></em>
          </ul>
      I also lived in Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia">DC</abbr> (unrelated to the military), and did three overseas deployments.
      </p>
      <p>I hope to graduate from Code Fellows and get a job as a software developer.</p>
